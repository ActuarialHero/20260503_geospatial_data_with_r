::: {.notes}
s2 was used by Tinder
h3 is used by Uber

Has an ever increasing number of territories as you zoom in
Good for finding things in close proximity
Alfa Mutual is the only reference to hexagonal geometries I could find. The IDs differ from h3 though, so they might have constructed their own hexagons

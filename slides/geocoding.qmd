- Geocoding

  - Lots of providers. Three examples:
    - ESRI ArcGIS: https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/geocode-addresses/
    - Google Maps: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/reference/rest/v4beta/GeocodeResult.Granularity
    - mapbox: https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/
  - Single point
  - Mailbox vs. building
    
  - May not be accurate, particularly for new properties
  
- Building Footprints
  - Outline of the entire building
